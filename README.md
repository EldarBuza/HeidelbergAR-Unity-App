# HeidelbergAR-Unity-App
Unity AR (Augmented reality) application I have developed on the course "Raƒçunarska grafika". I have created the model of the famous Heidelberg castle from scratch in Blender (this was my first Blender project ever, took me around 70 hours to do).
Since Github doesn't allow files larger than 100MB in size to be uploaded/pushed onto it without an extraordinary amount of extra steps, I have prepared a Google Drive folder with everything necessary for you to get to know the application.

Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hHRlCP2iFpEwQUqmM902nhB4r4_NUErm?usp=sharing

What this folder contains:
- .apk file of the actual finished application
- Video demo of the application on an Android phone (Xiaomi RedMi Note 11 Pro, but any Android SHOULD work fine as long as it's operating system is Android 8.0+)
- Renders of the model in blank and fancy environments
- .blend and .fbx files of the actual model used inside the application (Heidelberg castle model) which can be easily re-used or worked on in Blender or Unity
- Other models used were downloaded and re-used from https://www.sketchfab.com (Clock-tower model, Wine barrel model and Graduation hat model)
